# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a stylistically-attuned Large Language Model (LLM) framework specifically designed for generating poetry that faithfully replicates the distinctive styles of renowned poets. The system will integrate computational stylistics, supervised fine-tuning methodologies, and hybrid evaluation frameworks to address the fundamental challenge of achieving precise creative control in AI-generated poetry.

The framework aims to move beyond simple text generation to a more controlled and artistically intentional form of computational creativity, transforming abstract poetic concepts into concrete, actionable instructions for machine learning models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stylometric Analysis and Feature Extraction

**User Story:** As a poetry researcher, I want to quantitatively analyze and extract stylistic features from poets' works, so that I can create machine-readable profiles of their unique writing characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a poet's corpus is provided THEN the system SHALL extract structural features including stanzaic form, line count, meter, and rhyme schemes
2. WHEN analyzing lexical features THEN the system SHALL calculate Type-Token Ratio (TTR), vocabulary richness, word/sentence length distributions, and POS frequency
3. WHEN processing thematic elements THEN the system SHALL quantify imagery, symbolism, tone, and emotional intensity using computational methods
4. WHEN feature extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a quantitative stylistic profile with measurable metrics
5. IF the corpus contains insufficient data THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about statistical reliability

### Requirement 2: Data Curation and Preprocessing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to curate and preprocess high-quality poetry datasets, so that the fine-tuning process can learn accurate stylistic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw poetry text is input THEN the system SHALL clean and format the text removing irrelevant content
2. WHEN preprocessing poetry data THEN the system SHALL encode stylometric features as metadata tags for each line
3. WHEN creating training datasets THEN the system SHALL format data into instruction-output pairs suitable for supervised fine-tuning
4. WHEN augmenting training data THEN the system SHALL include explicit stylistic markers for meter, rhyme, and other features
5. IF data quality is insufficient THEN the system SHALL reject the corpus and provide specific feedback

### Requirement 3: Fine-Tuning Architecture and Training

**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to fine-tune a base LLM on poet-specific datasets, so that the model can generate poetry in specific stylistic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a base model THEN the system SHALL support both large models (GPT-4, Llama 3) and smaller models (LLaMA 2-7B)
2. WHEN fine-tuning begins THEN the system SHALL use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methodology with labeled input-output pairs
3. WHEN training on stylistic features THEN the system SHALL incorporate feature-encoded data augmentation beyond simple text mimicry
4. WHEN generating poetry THEN the system SHALL avoid repetitive patterns by understanding and applying poetic rules rather than simple token prediction
5. IF computational resources are limited THEN the system SHALL provide options for resource-constrained training

### Requirement 4: Quantitative Evaluation Framework

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to objectively measure the stylistic fidelity of generated poetry, so that I can validate the model's performance against established metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating generated poetry THEN the system SHALL calculate lexical richness using TTR and lexical density
2. WHEN assessing structural adherence THEN the system SHALL measure syllable count, line count, meter consistency, and rhyme scheme accuracy
3. WHEN analyzing linguistic features THEN the system SHALL compare POS usage and word frequency distributions
4. WHEN computing readability THEN the system SHALL generate readability scores comparable to the target poet's work
5. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive quantitative comparison report

### Requirement 5: Qualitative Evaluation Using PIMF Framework

**User Story:** As a literary critic, I want to assess the creative and artistic quality of generated poetry using structured evaluation criteria, so that I can provide meaningful feedback on the model's creative capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting qualitative evaluation THEN the system SHALL implement the Poetic Intensity Measurement Framework (PIMF) with 15 dimensions
2. WHEN assessing aesthetic form THEN the system SHALL evaluate creative imagination, unpredictability, and poetic alchemy
3. WHEN measuring cognitive depth THEN the system SHALL analyze linguistic creativity and structural complexity
4. WHEN evaluating affective resonance THEN the system SHALL assess emotional intensity and sonic quality
5. WHEN PIMF evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate normalized intensity scores for comparative analysis

### Requirement 6: Multi-Poet Style Modeling

**User Story:** As a creative writer, I want to generate poetry in the styles of different renowned poets, so that I can explore various poetic traditions and techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting Emily Dickinson style THEN the system SHALL generate poetry with frequent dashes, slant rhyme, and irregular capitalization
2. WHEN selecting Walt Whitman style THEN the system SHALL produce free verse with expansive cataloging and anaphoric repetition
3. WHEN selecting Edgar Allan Poe style THEN the system SHALL create poetry with consistent end rhyme, alliteration, and refrains
4. WHEN switching between poet styles THEN the system SHALL maintain distinct stylistic characteristics for each poet
5. IF an unsupported poet is requested THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on adding new poet profiles

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to generate poetry with specific stylistic controls, so that I can create customized poetic content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing input prompts THEN the system SHALL accept both simple text prompts and detailed stylistic specifications
2. WHEN generating poetry THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on stylistic adherence
3. WHEN reviewing output THEN the system SHALL display both the generated poem and its stylistic analysis
4. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL store generated poems with their evaluation metrics
5. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested corrections

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the poetry generation system to perform efficiently and scale appropriately, so that it can handle multiple users and requests reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing single requests THEN the system SHALL generate poetry within 30 seconds for standard prompts
2. WHEN handling multiple concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 60 seconds
3. WHEN scaling resources THEN the system SHALL support both local deployment and cloud-based infrastructure
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on generation speed and resource utilization
5. IF system resources are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide estimated wait times
